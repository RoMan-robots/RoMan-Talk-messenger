*coming soon* This will contain helper tools and functions to interact with GPT-2, text completion and compression.

## Tools
- support for all model sizes up until 1558M
- generate samples from a model using just CPU (out of the box or your own finetuned model)
- interact with running training process in Python
- downloader script for 117M, 345M, 774M and 1558M
- works on Linux and Windows (maybe apple, dunno)
- extreme text compression
- websocket server/client for piping generated text or progress
